## Setup Guide

__If you are someone who is looking to play on a server__, then you are already set up and ready to play! Cooperative servers can be found in the server browser just like any other server.

> #### üåê Player Downloads
>
> Upon joining a server, players will be able to automatically download most necessary files. For custom workshop maps in Black Mesa, players will have to manually subscribe to the Steam Workshop item before starting their game. [An official Steam Workshop collection containing all supported SourceCoop maps can be found here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2375865650).

__If you are a server operator who is looking to host your own cooperative server__, then follow a installation method below and forward the necessary ports:

| sourcecoop_thirdperson_enabled      |               | Enables whether if players are allowed to use thirdperson via chat command `!thirdperson`, console command `thirdperson` or the coop menu. Be aware that this requires enabling cheats on the client to work. Using thirdperson will break some weapon effects due to client-side prediction glitches. |            |

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FIRSTPERSON_DEATHCAM        | Enables the first-person death camera.                                                                                          |
| HEV_SOUNDS                  | Enables HEV sounds.                                                                                                         |
| INSTANCE_ITEMS              | Instances pickup items and weapons for each player. Instanced items disappear once picked up and 'respawn' along with the player.        |
| INSTANCE_ITEMS_NORESET      | If enabled, items will not 'respawn' picked up items after death.                                                                       |
| KEEP_EQUIPMENT              | Makes players spawn with previously picked up equipment (suit, weapons). Global for all players.                               |
| STRIP_DEFAULT_EQUIPMENT     | Removes default multiplayer equipment.                                                                                         |
| STRIP_DEFAULT_EQUIPMENT_KEEPSUIT |                                                                                                                                  |
| DISABLE_CANISTER_DROPS      | Disables item drops when players die in multiplayer.                                                                             |
| NO_TELEFRAGGING             | Prevents teleporting props and players from slaying other players.                                                             |
| NOBLOCK                     | Prevents player-on-player collisions. (This feature requires `mp_teamplay 1` to fix smoothness issues.)                                                        |
| SHOW_WELCOME_MESSAGE        | Shows players a greeting message with basic plugin info.                                                                       |
| AUTODETECT_MAP_END          | Detects commonly used commands for ending singleplayer maps from `point_clientcommand` and `point_servercommand` entities and changes the map. At first, this feature checks `sourcecoop_homemap` is set (see below), then checks if `nextmap` is set. If none are set, the map is not changed. Recommended to keep enabled. |
| CHANGELEVEL_FX              | Show visual effects (spawn particles) at level change locations.                                                               |
| TRANSFER_PLAYER_STATE       | Enables player persistence through level changes. Currently, players will carry over their health, armor and equipment for the first spawn point (checkpoint) in the map. Afterwards, the default map equipment is used. |
